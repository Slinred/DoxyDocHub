# DoxyDocHub

DoxyDocHub is a webserver designed to host and manage Doxygen-generated HTML documentation for software projects. It provides a RESTful API endpoint for uploading documentation archives along with essential metadata, making it easy to organize and share project documentation.

## Features

1. [ ] **API for uploads:** Accepts compressed archives (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz) containing Doxygen HTML output. The documentation is then stored locally and is accessible via `/[<root_project>/]<project_name>/<version>`
1. [ ] **Overview**: The main page shows an overview/browser off all available projects and their published versions
1. [ ] **Metadata support:** Requires project name, version or commit hash, origin reference link, and supports extendable user-defined metadata.
